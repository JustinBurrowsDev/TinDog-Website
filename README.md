### Challenges I Faced - 

At this current moment I’m not really familiar with the bootstrap library. And up until now I’ve only read and done exercises with HTML and CSS I haven’t really put it to practical use. It was really hard for me to imagine the end product in my mind in regards to the code, it seemed easy enough visually, but the concept overall is a little foggy. 


### How I overcame? 

By doing research on platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stack Overflow, online courses, and reference guides. I found not only the proper way to implement HTML and CSS but official documentation for bootstrap. These tools not only gave me a clearer vision of how this project could come together, Who also gave me the means to bring that vision into reality.
